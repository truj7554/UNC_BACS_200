<h1> How to Make a Search Bar </h1>
<h2> Step 1: HTML Code Required</h2>
    <p>A. Using Ctrl+U look at the code for this website and copy the HTML for the following Searchbar</p>
    <div class="topnav">
  <a class="active" href="#home">Home</a>
  <a href="#about">About</a>
  <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Search..">
</div>
    <p>B.Post that html into brackets and see how it comes out! Notice that it is very bare bones without any CSS in your browser.</p>
    <h2>Step 2: Edit your searchbar using CSS</h2>
    <p>Notice how my searchbar has some added flare. By copying my teach.css file you can find some easy ways to edit your searchbar. Try adding CSS to your page and playing with the colors! Some suggested edits by w3 schools are included in the code.</p>
